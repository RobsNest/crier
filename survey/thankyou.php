Thank you for participating in this survey.
<br /><br />
This is both a campaign season and a time for citizens to carefully weigh in on the decisions being made by city officials.  I have often asked that citizens provide consensus on matters of significance in Cumberland and for the last three years, the need for consensus has grown.  Your input will assist me in making decisions at City Hall, knowing the thoughts, concerns and priorities of Cumberland residents.
<br /><br />
Throughout the campaign season, I encourage you to ask questions of city candidates who make promises to you to change tax rates, change services, or alter the priorities of City Hall.  The most basic question to ask is “how,” as well as “how will you pay for it?”  Weigh what you hear very carefully, as the responses I will give you are the truth, consistent with my tenure in office, and with a working knowledge of city operations, needs and resources.  
<br /><br />
My family instilled in me a commitment to community.  I consider serving in elected office as civic service, but I don’t believe that these positions of responsibility are to be taken lightly nor are incumbents entitled to retain them.  I have worked tirelessly to fulfill my responsibilities and remain proud of what has been accomplished in Cumberland in these past few years.
<br /><br />
I will conduct a campaign based upon accomplishments during my tenure.  I won't tell you what you want to hear to make you happy and win your vote.  Instead, I will tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, even when it's unpopular.  I will not make promises that I cannot keep.  I will continue to "Be Bold" in efforts to move the city forward and I ask you to join my campaign of honesty, transparency, and realistic solutions!
<br /><br />
I do not make decisions based upon the election calendar and I don’t believe in kicking problems down the road for somebody else to solve.  I am committed to continuing to tackle the challenges we face, even when they are politically unpopular.
<br /><br />
Stand up for truth, transparency and responsible solutions; join me online today at <a href="http://www.reelectthemayor.com">www.ReElectTheMayor.com</a>.  The results of the survey will ultimately be displayed there.
<br /><br />
Thank you again for participating and for demonstrating your care and concern for Cumberland.
